# CS2340SmartWorks

There are too many IoTs in a house today. In this project, we developed a SmartHome software that customers would be able to control and monitor IoTs in the house.

Our program fulfills the below:

1. The customer will be able to perform real-time management of the IoTs and be able to configure the house into different configurations such as travel mode, alarm method settings, emergency responses, alert/alarm handling, play movie etc.

2. The customer would be able to locate/relocate devices/sensors on different floor plans.

3. The customer would be able to customize different zone setting of devices/sensors in the zone.

4. Customer will be able to add, remove and initialize different IoTs with customized parameters

5. The system should be real-time security features such as authentication of user access
